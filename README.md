For identifying crypto coins that have dipped (fallen in price) and are starting to recover in the past few days.
I use the coins daily [RSI](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_index_rsi) to identify whether the coin has already dipped and there after do some more analysis.
